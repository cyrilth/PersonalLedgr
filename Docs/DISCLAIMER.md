## No Financial Advice

This software is **not** a substitute for professional financial, tax, or legal advice. Nothing in this application should be interpreted as financial guidance or a recommendation to take any specific financial action.

## No Liability for Data Accuracy

The developer is **not responsible** for:

- **Data loss** — including but not limited to database corruption, failed backups, migration errors, or accidental deletion
- **Inaccurate calculations** — interest accrual, amortization schedules, APR calculations, balance tracking, and budget figures are approximations and may not match your financial institution's figures exactly
- **Misreported balances** — stored balances may drift from actual bank balances due to timing, manual entry errors, import discrepancies, or synchronization issues
- **Double-counted or missing transactions** — while the application is designed to prevent double-counting, no system is infallible
- **Incorrect interest or payment projections** — extra payment calculators, payoff date estimates, and interest projections are for informational purposes only

## User Responsibility

Users are solely responsible for:

- Verifying all financial data independently against their bank and financial institution statements
- Maintaining their own backups of critical financial records
- Making their own informed financial decisions
- Ensuring the accuracy of manually entered data
- Reviewing imported and auto-synced transactions for correctness
